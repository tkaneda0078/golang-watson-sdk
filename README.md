Done as an exercise for me to learn how the API works.

https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud has sdks for Java and Node, the idea here is to add the barebones for a Golang one.

https://github.com/liviosoares/go-watson-sdk this one is far more feature rich than mine, on the off-chance you found mine and not this!
